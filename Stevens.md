Q1. In the readings for Tuesday and today, the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe  in general and basc terms how it works.

In the article, the researchers describe a dasymetric redistribution approach based on the populaton counts from census data  and a new technique called "Random Forest". This flexible modeling framework helps to incorporate the remotely sensed and geospatial data from multiple scales into the dasymetric model. "Random Forest" is then used to generate a gridded prediction of population density. We can show the dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level by using the prediction layer.

Q2. The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithm can be seen as a subset of aritificial intelligence which can improve its predicted output automatically. A data science machine learning method is more accurate than the previous classical statistical approaches. It incorporates more variables in the calculation and value the variables differently to make the output more precise.

Q3. In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distribution?

These covariate data sets include night-time lights, topography, land cover and climatic information. The 10km buffered polygon of national borders of each country is converted to a raster grid, with approximately 100 meter by 100 meter pixels, and serves as a template for all other covariates to be projected. Big data helps improve machine learning methods and make the prediction more accurate and efficient.

Q4. The authors' result present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate desription of where each person is located across planet earth?

Having a highly accurate description of where each person is located is important when when dealing with issues in health, economic, and environmental fields. It helps the government and organizations to make more effective plans and decisions to solve all kinds problems.

Q5. Within the context of human developmen in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

My area of investigation is Haiti. The education and health resources are scarce and having a highly accurate description of where each household is can help to aid the families that need these resources. When some disasters such as earthquake come, it is also crucial to identify where each household is located to carry out the rescue.
