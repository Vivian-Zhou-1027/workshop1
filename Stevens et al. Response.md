1. In the readings for Tuesday and today, the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe  in general and basc terms how it works.

In the article, the researchers describe a dasymetric redistribution approach based on the populaton counts from census data  and a new technique called "Random Forest". This flexible modeling framework helps to incorporate the remotely sensed and geospatial data from multiple scales into the dasymetric model. "Random Forest" is then used to generate a gridded prediction of population density. We can show the dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level by using the prediction layer.

2. The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithm can be seen as a subset of aritificial intelligence which can improve its predicted output automatically. A data science machine learning method is more accurate than the previous classical statistical approaches. It incorporates more variables in the calculation and value the variables differently to make the output more precise.

3. In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms) what is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distribution.

correlates/ drivers of human population distribution
These covariate data sets include night-time lights (e.g. Suomi NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)-derived data), to- pography (e.g. USGS SRTM-derived HydroSheds, ASTER DEM products), land cover (e.g. Landsat-derived classified data sets) and climatic information 
country-specific data include road and river networks, population center and building locations, protected area boundaries, and demography, among others
elevation, slope, spatially explicit climate data
We also include the best available lights at night data, collected via satellite and mosa- icked into a continuous dataset, subset to each country of interest 


4. The authors' result present a remarkable improvement over precious geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate desription of where each person is loacated across planet earth?

By using this flexi- ble weighting algorithm we improve upon existing, freely available population mapping ap- proaches and increase our ability to provide updated population maps for countries with census and ancillary data at spatial scales relevant to country-level population density maps.

5. Within the context of human developmen in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?
