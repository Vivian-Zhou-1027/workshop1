In the readings for Tuesday and today, the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe  in general and basc terms how it works.
Random Forest.
Machine learning algorithm.
The population mapping method presented here creates a dasymetric weighting scheme using an iterative Random Forest (RF) model with multiple ancillary data sources. By using this flexi- ble weighting algorithm we improve upon existing, freely available population mapping ap- proaches and increase our ability to provide updated population maps for countries with census and ancillary data at spatial scales relevant to country-level population density maps.
