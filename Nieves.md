# Nieves et al Response 

Vivian Zhou March 25

Question: Nieves et al use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works. What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Nieves et al use the random forest machine learning method to predict the population globally. Random Forest is a type of "ensemble method" which takes individual decision trees that are considered ‘weak learners’ and combine them to create a ‘strong learner’. They create a population density layer using census units and then dasymetric modeling is used to estimate the population counts. A dasymmetric population allocation shows the population layer from input census based on the covariate data. The research found that covariates within the urban/suburban extents and built environment and urban/suburban proxy classes would be the most important for predicting population density.
