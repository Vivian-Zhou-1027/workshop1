# Project 3: Haiti

## Part 1: De facto description of human settlements and urban areas
I chose Jacmel for the first part of project 3. It is located on the southern part of the country. The plot shows the location of urbanized areas in Jacmel. The total population of Jacmel is about 137,000 and the total number of distinctly defined human settlements or urban areas is 7 as shown on the plot. All of these urban areas have high density and high population.

## Part 2: Adding transportation facilities & health care services
For this part, I focused on two adm2s, Jacmel and Bainet. The orange lines are the road networks. Since Haiti has a large number of unclassified road net works, the plot shows a lot of disconnected tracks. The red points represent hospitals and the yellow ones represent other health care facilities. The locations of these facilities are mostly consistent with the positions of urban areas.
