# Project 1:  Haiti

## Administrative Subdivisions of Haiti

This is a map of Haiti with administrative level 1 and 2 labeled. I made the color of the map red with blue labels of names of administrative subdivisions because the flag of Haiti is colored red and blue.
## Population of Haiti

This map shows the population distribution of Haiti. The administrative subdivision, Ouest, with the largest population is where the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, is located.
## Haiti in 2019 Graph

This graph shows the population, density, and population share of Haiti. When I was working on this graph, I had a problem showing the percentage on the bar plot. That was because I forgot to library scales in my script, and I fixed it successfully after adding the command. Generally, I did not have many difficulties working on the project. However, I planned to do project on Peru at first place. I found that it took so long for my computer to run the program so I changed it into Haiti, which turned out to be a wise decision.
