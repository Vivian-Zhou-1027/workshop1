Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of different openly available geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?
 
The authors write about four ‘base’ standardised 100 m tiled datasets and 30 arc-second global mosaic derivations that have been generated. The four 100 m resolution datasets form are topography, standardised, gridded, and clipped to country coastal boundaries; a slope layer calculated from the topography; a country identification grid; and a country area (km2) grid derived from this. The Gridded population distribution datasets generally provide more accurate results than a conventional census. These can also regularly update the country boundaries and coastlines, and covariate layers representing different time periods created at fine spatial resolutions.
