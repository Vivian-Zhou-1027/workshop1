In the reading for today, the author introduce a top-down method as well as a bottom-up method. Describe the two methods. Compare and contrast. What adventages do these new methodologies present when compared to past approaches? Example of each? 

The top-down method means that we collect data on a large scale and we disaggregate them into smaller ones. We use census population counts and geospatial covariates and disaggregate the data and finally we have the gridded population. This method is usually accurate and have detailed and valuable representations. However, some low income countries may not have up-to-date data and reliability of input population data may be questioned.

The bottom-up method is to estimate the whole picture by using data from small, defined areas. For example, we use the population data provided by microcensus surveys and some covariates, such as the existence of satellites, which correlated to the data to estimate the population by using some sort of statistical approaches. This method can be efficient and effective but we need to be careful with the original data collected and the interpretation of the results.

Both of the methods are effective methods. The bottom-up method, compared to the old one, costs less and increases its accuracy by using covariates. We can use the bottom-up method as the complementary of the top-down method in order to have more precise data. We should also deal with the results carefully when making serious decisions.
