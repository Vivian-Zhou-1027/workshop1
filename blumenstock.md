# Response to Blumenstock
Vivian Zhou

In his article, Blumenstock believes that with big data can be helpful to human development when carefully used. It may improve public-health interventions during an epidemic, or assist national and international responses to crises. However, these large amount of information from satellites, mobile phones and other sources is not a panacea. He states that big data have pitfalls. Since the power to derive value from the data tends to be concentrated in the hands of a few, solutions derived by big data may be in favor of those enpowered ones instead of some vulnerable people. Some private company may misuse the information to maximize their profit. Also, The algorithms can be inaccurate as time passes. Some steps that can be taken to try to address these concerns are to validate the new sources of data instead of replacing the old ones, to customize the core technology, and to deepen collaboration between data scientists, devel- opment experts, governments, civil society and the private sector.
