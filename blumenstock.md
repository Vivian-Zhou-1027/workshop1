# Response to Blumenstock
Vivian Zhou

The promise Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis is that big data may improve public-health interventions during an epidemic, or assist national and international responses to crises. He also wrote about four pitfalls, unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. Some steps that can be taken to try to address these concerns are to validate the new sources of data instead of replacing the old ones, to customize the core technology, and to deepen collaboration between data scientists, devel- opment experts, governments, civil society and the private sector.
