## Part 2: Modeling & Predicting Spatial Values

### Population and Differences Maps of Haiti
![Population Map of Haiti](haiti_pop.png)
This map shows the population of Haiti in 2015.
![Difference Map of Haiti](haiti_diff.png)
This plot shows the difference between the population predicted by the model and the actual population in 2015 for Haiti. The population of the reddish part is underestimated.
